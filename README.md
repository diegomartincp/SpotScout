<h1>SpotScout
<img src="src/assets/images/spotscout_logo.png" width="100" title="hover text"></h1>This project delivers a web interface built with Angular to explore housing prices across different neighborhoods, combining real estate data with machine learning and natural language processing.
- Prediction and visualization of housing prices by area, powered by machine learning models trained on up-to-date datasets.
- Real-time sentiment analysis on posts referencing various neighborhoods, retrieved via the X (Twitter) API, to uncover the community’s perception of each district.
- A modern, interactive front end enabling you to compare neighborhoods, review historical trends, and uncover key insights from both “hard” data and public sentiment.
